## Notification System
Notification systems configurations for the orders can be found in `Modules > Orders > Config > config.php` 

In that configuration file, you will be able to set notification groups and their respective emails. 
When an order status has been updated, then the notification is sent to the user dashboard. 

**There is not email notification, only session/ database notifications**
